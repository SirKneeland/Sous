# Sous

A phone-first “Chat + Living Recipe Canvas” app.

Sous treats a recipe as a persistent, stateful document that an AI can co-edit in real time.  
Chat never reprints the recipe. The AI mutates a living canvas instead.

v1 focus:
- Dual-pane UI (recipe + chat)
- Checkable, stateful cooking steps
- No past edits: completed steps are immutable

This repo currently contains Milestone 1: the recipe canvas and cooking UX.
